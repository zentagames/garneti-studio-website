    </p>

    <p>
        It's important to understand that Garneti Studio retains full authority to manage, regulate, control,

        termination of your account. Additionally, all Virtual Items are forfeited if your account is
        suspended or terminated for any reason, or if Garneti Studio discontinues providing the services.
    </p>

    <p>
        By using our services, you agree not to assert or bring any claim against Garneti Studio, its
        affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, or licensors in relation to (i) claiming
        ownership of any Virtual Items or (ii) seeking monetary compensation for the perceived value of
        Virtual Items lost due to the deletion or suspension of your account, or the modification,
        termination, or expiration of these terms.
    </p>

        account and turning off the renewal. To avoid being charged for the next subscription billing period,
        please ensure you cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before the current subscription period
        expires.
    </p>

    <p>
        For subscription services purchased within a Game, the App Store will handle the billing and charge
        you accordingly, subject to the App Store's payment terms. It is recommended that you review the
        payment terms of the appropriate App Store for further information.
    </p>

    <p>
        All sales made through our services are considered final. It is important to acknowledge and agree
        that any fees and charges incurred (including virtual items) are non-refundable, either in whole or
        in part. You bear full responsibility for all charges to your account, including unauthorized
        charges. Please note that Garneti Studio does not provide refunds or exchanges for any products
        purchased on or through our services.
    </p>

        refund, monetary compensation, or any form of compensation for unused virtual items or other in-game
        assets in the event of service termination, whether such termination is voluntary or involuntary and
        without prior notice.

    <h2>12. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h2>
    <p>
        The services and/or games may provide links to Third-party services, or may make Third-party services
        available to you within the services or games. These Third-party services can include features such
        as gameplay recording and sharing, social media connectivity, advertisements placed and more. You
        acknowledge and agree that Third-party services are governed by their respective terms and
        conditions. It is important for you to read and understand these Third-party terms and conditions, as
        they form an agreement between you and the Third-party service provider.
    </p>

    <h2>13. APPLICATION STORES</h2>
    <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Game is dependent on the third-party
        Application Store from which you obtained the Game, such as the Apple iPhone or Android stores. You
        understand that this Agreement is between you and RG (the game developer) and not with the
        Application Store. The Application Store is not responsible for the Game itself, its content,
        maintenance, support services, warranty, or addressing any claims related to the Game (such as
        product liability, legal compliance, or intellectual property infringement). You are responsible for
        paying any fees charged by the Application Store in connection with the Game, if applicable. Your use
        of the Game is subject to your compliance with all applicable third-party terms of agreement,
        including the terms and policies of the Application Store. You acknowledge that the Application Store
        and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement and have the right to enforce
        this Agreement.
